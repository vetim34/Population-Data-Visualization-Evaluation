# Population-Data-Visualization-Evaluation
The aim of this visualization exercise was to inspect and gather insights on the population growth data in countries like Nigeria, Sudan and Kenya from 1950 - 2020. And with the help of some Power BI tools, I was able to predict and estimate the population growth potential within a span of 5 years.
